Born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, Patel was an astute lawyer and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. He is best known for his leadership during the Salt March and his efforts in uniting Indiaâ€™s diverse princely states into the Indian Union post-independence. As the first Deputy Prime Minister and the first Home Minister of India, Patel was instrumental in consolidating the newly independent nation. His political acumen, strong leadership, and commitment to national unity earned him the admiration of many, and his legacy continues to influence India's political landscape. His contribution to building a united, secular India, overcoming the challenges of partition, and promoting social harmony remains central to his legacy."),
